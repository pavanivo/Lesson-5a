### Class 5: Introduction to Machine Learning

**ML Resources:**
* For a very quick summary of the key points about machine learning, watch [What is machine learning, and how does it work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk) (10 minutes) or read the associated [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos/blob/master/01_machine_learning_intro.ipynb).
* For a more in-depth introduction to machine learning, read section 2.1 (14 pages) of Hastie and Tibshirani's excellent book, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). (It's a free PDF download!)
* For a really nice comparison of supervised versus unsupervised learning, plus an introduction to reinforcement learning, watch this [video](http://work.caltech.edu/library/014.html) (13 minutes) from Caltech's [Learning From Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course.
* For a preview of some of the machine learning content we will cover during the course, read Sebastian Raschka's [overview of the supervised learning process](https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/machine_learning/supervised_intro/introduction_to_supervised_machine_learning.md).
* Which machine learning [algorithm should I use](http://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2017/04/12/machine-learning-algorithm-use/?utm_content=buffera231f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer
)

**Statistics Resources:**
* Read [How Software in Half of NYC Cabs Generates $5.2 Million a Year in Extra Tips](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/107245431809/how-software-in-half-of-nyc-cabs-generates-5-2) for an excellent example of exploratory data analysis.
* Read [Anscombe's Quartet, and Why Summary Statistics Don't Tell the Whole Story](http://data.heapanalytics.com/anscombes-quartet-and-why-summary-statistics-dont-tell-the-whole-story/) for a classic example of why visualization is useful.
* [What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/13/what-i-do-when-i-get-a-new-data-set-as-told-through-tweets/) is a fun (yet enlightening) look at the process of exploratory data analysis.
* [Khan Academy Statistics and Probabiliy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) Good refresher if you need it.
* [ThinkStats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) Good statistics book with Python code in NumPy and Pandas.
* [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction) Sample variance is incredibly complicated once you look into it, but that makes it one of the simplest examples of meaningful bias and variance.
* [Bias of a estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator) More on bias of the sample variance estimator.
* [Mean Squared Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) In many fields we obsess about unbiased estimators, in machine learning we obsess about MSE. More examples of the sample variance estimator. 
* [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) Deep topic that we will dive into later in the course, worth a preview.
